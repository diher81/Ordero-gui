## Örder GUI

Minimalistic skeleton using Vaading 7.X (customer requirement) and Spring Boot 2.X.
The configuration is done, however, the code itself should be refactored (we only have a single view, hardcoded url's,...)

- Single UI view
- Simple HTTP call to Örder backend (port 9000)

## Running Locally
- Execute `mvn clean install` to run the build
- Run `Application.java` to start the (embedded Tomcat)
    - Surf to `http://localhost:8844`
